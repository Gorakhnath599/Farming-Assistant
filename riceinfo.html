      <h1>Rice</h1>
    </div>
    <h1>About rice</h1>
    <p><b>Oryza Sativa</b>, commonly known as rice, is commonly linked to wet and humid climates, despite not being
      inherently tropical. Its ancestry is thought to be rooted in wild grasses, possibly nurtured in the foothills of
      the far Eastern Himalayas. Alternatively, some theories propose that the rice plant could have originated in
      southern India before progressing northward within the country and eventually spreading to China. This journey
      continued with its introduction to Korea, the Philippines (around 2000 B.C.), and subsequently reaching Japan and
      Indonesia (around 1000 B.C.).</p>
    <p>The global diffusion of rice was gradual, yet once established, it firmly entrenched itself as a pivotal
      agricultural and economic commodity for communities. Within the Indian subcontinent, an impressive portion of
      cultivated land, exceeding a quarter, is dedicated to rice cultivation (2011-12). This staple grain forms an
      indispensable component of daily diets, particularly in the southern and eastern regions of India. Even in the
      northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat consumption is prominent, rice maintains its
      significance. It is a daily culinary fixture as well as a featured dish during festivities and special occasions.
      This is the historical trajectory of rice within India.</h1>
    <p>India holds a significant status as a pivotal hub for rice cultivation, boasting the largest expanse of
      rice-growing areas. Historians assert that the initial domestication of the <b>indica</b> rice variety occurred
      within the vicinity spanning the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas, encompassing north-eastern India. This region
      extended through Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Southern China. In contrast, the <b>japonica</b> variety of
      rice is believed to have been domesticated from wild rice in southern China and subsequently introduced to India.
      Notably, perennial wild rice still thrives in regions like Assam and Nepal.

      Around 1400 BC, evidence suggests that rice cultivation began to flourish in southern India, following its
      domestication in the northern plains. This cultivation practice gradually expanded to encompass all fertile
      alluvial plains, nourished by rivers. Some theories propose that the term "rice" finds its origins in the Tamil
      word <b>arisi</b>.</p>
    <h1>Climatic Requirements</h1>
    <p>Rice cultivation in India is adapted to a diverse range of altitudes and climatic conditions. Its growth spans
      from the latitude of 8 to 35 degrees north, and elevations ranging from sea level to altitudes as high as 3000
      meters. The optimal conditions for rice cultivation entail a warm and humid climate, making it particularly
      well-suited for regions characterized by high levels of humidity, extended periods of sunshine, and a reliable
      water supply. The ideal temperature range throughout the crop's lifecycle lies between 21 to 37 degrees Celsius.
      While the rice crop can endure temperatures as high as 40 to 42 degrees Celsius, these extremes are at the upper
      limit of its tolerance.</p>

    <h1>Nutritional value of Rice</h1>

    <p>Rice stands as a foundational nutritional staple, offering rapid energy due to its primary component,
      carbohydrates (starch). Conversely, rice exhibits a deficiency in nitrogenous compounds, with a modest 8% average
      composition, while its fat content, or lipids, remains negligible, measuring only 1%. This nutritional profile
      renders rice a comprehensive food source.

      The richness of starch in rice flour makes it a pivotal ingredient for crafting various food products. Moreover,
      brewers employ rice in certain contexts to create alcoholic malt. Beyond its culinary applications, a blend of
      rice straw and other materials yields raw materials for the production of porcelain, glass, and pottery. The
      versatile nature of rice extends to industries such as paper pulp manufacturing and livestock bedding.</p>
    <p>The diversity in composition and attributes of rice spans a wide spectrum, contingent upon the specific variety
      and the environmental circumstances in which the crop is cultivated. Within husked rice, the protein content
      exhibits a range spanning from 7% to 12%. Notably, the application of nitrogen-based fertilizers contributes to an
      augmentation in the proportion of certain amino acids.</p>
    <h1>Medicinal Value</h1>
    <p>The extensive array of rice germplasm serves as a valuable reservoir for a multitude of rice-based products,
      while also being harnessed for addressing various health-related ailments such as indigestion, diabetes,
      arthritis, paralysis, and epilepsy. Additionally, these rice varieties contribute to the well-being of pregnant
      and lactating mothers by providing essential strength. The ancient Ayurvedic literature attests to the therapeutic
      and remedial attributes exhibited by diverse rice types cultivated in India.

      Across the nation, there are distinct medicinal rice varieties, like Kanthi Banko from Chhattisgarh, Meher,
      Saraiphul & Danwar from Orissa, and Atikaya & Kari Bhatta from Karnataka, that are commonly utilized. Furthermore,
      certain varieties grown in specific pockets of Kerala are renowned for their medicinal properties, including
      Chennellu, Kunjinellu, Erumakkari & Karuthachembavu, among others.</p>
    <h1>Crop Production Practices</h1>
    <p>Rice cultivation in India predominantly takes place in two distinct types of soils: (i) uplands and (ii)
      lowlands. The approach to rice cultivation within a specific region hinges on various factors, including land
      conditions, soil types, irrigation accessibility, labor availability, and the pattern of rainfall distribution.
      The cultivation of rice encompasses the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation
        <ul>
          <li>Broadcasting the seed</li>
          <li>Sowing the seed behind the plough or drilling</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Wet or lowland cultivation
        <ul>
          <li>Transplanting in puddled fields.</li>
          <li>Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Selection of Seeds</h1>
    <p>Achieving optimal crop yield in rice cultivation hinges significantly on the utilization of high-quality seeds.
      Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the selection of superior seeds. The quality of seed
      significantly influences the successful cultivation of robust seedlings. Seeds designated for sowing need to meet
      the subsequent prerequisites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.</li>
      <li>The seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.</li>
      <li>The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size.</li>
      <li>The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.</li>
      <li>The seed should have a high germinating capacity.</li>

    </ul>
